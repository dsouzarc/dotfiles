#The Story

###2014
Throughout all of 2014, I had the Samsung Galaxy S4. I primarily used stock-apps with the exception of texting (QKSMS) and camera (switched to using Google Camera in May 2014)

I would backup my photos to Google+ Photos, where they would remain hidden.

###What went wrong - Multifold

+ Many, many duplicates
    - If I took a photo on Snapchat and downloaded the snap, the photo would show up in two folders: 'All Photos' and 'Snapchat'
    - I had the enhance quality enabled on Google+ Photos so for every photo I backed up, Google+ would store two versions: a slightly compressed version of the original photo I took on my device (Version B) and an edited/enhanced version (Version C). I did not know about the 'Version C' photo until I downloaded all of my Google+ Photos to my computer and looked through them

+ SD Card problems
    = On Android version 4.4 (Kitkat), Google had taken steps to stop rogue apps from viewing other apps'
