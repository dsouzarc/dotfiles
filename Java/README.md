#The Story

###2014
Throughout all of 2014, I had the Samsung Galaxy S4. I primarily used stock-apps with the exception of texting (QKSMS) and camera (switched to using Google Camera in May 2014)

I would backup my photos to Google+ Photos, where they would remain hidden.

###What went wrong - Multifold

+ Many, many duplicates
    - If I took a photo on Snapchat and downloaded the snap, the photo would show up in two folders: 'All Photos' and 'Snapchat'
    - I had the enhance quality enabled on Google+ Photos so for every photo I backed up, Google+ would store two versions: a slightly compressed version of the original photo I took on my device (Version B) and an edited/enhanced version (Version C). I did not know about the 'Version C' photo until I downloaded all of my Google+ Photos to my computer and looked through them

+ SD Card problems
    - On Android version 4.4 (Kitkat), Google had taken steps to stop rogue apps from viewing other apps' data stored on the SD card by restricting what data could be stored on the card and which apps had access to it
    - For some unknown reason - probably because of TouchWiz + Kitkat - I was unable to store my photos on my SD Card. I was also unable to store my downloaded songs/playlists from Spotify (Spotify Premium user) to my SD card, most likely because of Spotify. 
    - I decided it was best to root my 16GB Galaxy S4 in order to use an app that would trick apps into thinking my SD card was internal memory and would allow me to store a ton of apps' data on my SD card
        + My phone became setup like this: Spotify music on SD Card, old photos on SD card, newest photos on phone's internal memory before being moved to SD Card when space ran out. Also, all photos were backed up to Google+.
    - Worked well until I was halfway through my trip to Vienna, Salzburg, and Prague. For some weird reason, something happened to the write permissions that did not allow me to move my photos from my internal memory to SD Card. **I lost over 450 photos of the most historic and beautiful places in Vienna and Salzburg because Samsung 'successfully moved' photos to the SD card when it really did not**.
    - I thought it was a glitch and continued on with my trip, but the problems just got worse and worse.
    - In July, my write problems were severe - I could not even delete files from the SD card - and I broke the card in half and sent it to SanDisk to get a replacement 64GB SD card (under warranty)
    - I kept a few photos on that SD card, but nothing from that year's earlier trips to **London, Paris, Salzburg, Vienna, and Prague**.
