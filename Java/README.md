#The Story

###2014
Throughout all of 2014, I had the Samsung Galaxy S4. I primarily used stock-apps with the exception of texting (QKSMS) and camera (switched to using Google Camera in May 2014)

I would backup my photos to Google+ Photos, where they would remain hidden.

###What went wrong - Multifold

+ Many, many duplicates
    - If I took a photo on Snapchat and downloaded the snap, the photo would show up in two folders: 'All Photos' and 'Snapchat'
    - I had the enhance quality enabled on Google+ Photos so for every photo I backed up, Google+ would store two versions: a slightly compressed version of the original photo I took on my device (Version B) and an edited/enhanced version (Version C). I did not know about the 'Version C' photo until I downloaded all of my Google+ Photos to my computer and looked through them

+ SD Card problems
    - On Android version 4.4 (Kitkat), Google had taken steps to stop rogue apps from viewing other apps' data stored on the SD card by restricting what data could be stored on the card and which apps had access to it
    - For some unknown reason - probably because of TouchWiz + Kitkat - I was unable to store my photos on my SD Card. I was also unable to store my downloaded songs/playlists from Spotify (Spotify Premium user) to my SD card, most likely because of Spotify. 
    - I decided it was best to root my 16GB Galaxy S4 in order to use an app that would trick apps into thinking my SD card was internal memory and would allow me to store a ton of apps' data on my SD card
    - Worked well until
