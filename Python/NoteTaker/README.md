###Takes notes on a book

Book must be formatted as a PDF for page number reasons.

Disclaimer: I do not condone cheating.

####Dependencies & Installation
    None, just download this directory

####Run Instructions
Change the variables in lines 13 - 16 of **NoteTaker.py** 

    python NoteTaker.py

Takes about 2 seconds to generate 5 pages of notes for a 250 page book

Each time you run the above line, a different set of notes is generated, so if you're not happy with the current notes, you can run it again to regenerate a new set of notes.

The notes will be created and stored as both a .docx and a .markdown file for your convenience.

In both file cases, the format for a note is:
- **Page X: ** Some note or quotation.

I strongly recommend reading through the resulting files to fix grammatical errors, strange formatting, and misplaced titles. 

For exporting .markdown notes to a neatly generated PDF, I recommend Byword
